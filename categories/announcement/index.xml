      <description>Happy 2020, folks! We&amp;rsquo;re kicking off the new year with our first meetup. This January 13 we&amp;rsquo;ll be at WeWork Uptown BGC with two speakers from Brankas. The meetup would be great for beginners and advanced developers in Go. Don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the language? There&amp;rsquo;s something for you too!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a Go newbie or are interested on learning the language, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to Junior Systems Engineer Carlos Daroya.</description>

      <description>Are you interested in using Go in your company but need more information from people who are already using it in the enterprise? This October we&amp;rsquo;ll look at two companies and discover how they use Go in their systems. Both Johnny Estilles (Director of Engineering, Freelancer.com) and Miguel Martinez (System Developer, Brankas) will be discussing why they decided to use the language and the results of going for a technology that not many are locally using at the moment.</description>
